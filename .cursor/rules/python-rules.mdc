Rules:
- Before executing any Python-related commands or running code from a Python package, first check if a virtual environment exists by looking for a 'venv' directory in the current project. If it exists, activate it by running "source ./venv/bin/activate" or "source {location of activate script}" before proceeding with the command.
- When installing python packages or adding to requirements.txt, you must use web search or pip to ensure it is the latest version unless otherwise specified by other library version requirements..
